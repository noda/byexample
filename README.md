## Building the site

There is a Makefile in the root of the repository. The following targets are available:

* `make all` - build all examples and the index
* `make index` - build the index
* `make examples` - build all examples

The build files is stored in the docs directory which is a GitHub pages site.

Whenever the master branch is updated the site is automatically built and published.
